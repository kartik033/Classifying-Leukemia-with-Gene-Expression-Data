# Classifying-Leukemia-with-Gene-Expression-Data
using gene expression patterns, and to check multiple machine learning models to evaluate which works the best by implementing multiple models, including logistic regression, SVM, random forest, XG boost, and a Deep Learning model.

Main Goal
The primary goal of this project is to develop and evaluate and machine learning models that will classify between ALL and AML based on microarray gene expression data.
Specific objectives include:
•	Preprocess and clean gene expression data from the GEO database (GSE13159)
•	Perform dimensions Lucky threw probe to gene mapping.
•	Implement multiple classification algorithms: Logistic Regression, Linear SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Deep Neural Networks
•	Evaluate models using 5-fold stratified cross-validation with multiple metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC)
•	Compare model performance and identify the most effective approach for clinical leukemia classification
•	Provide interpretability analysis of which genes are most important for classification
